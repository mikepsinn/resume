# Mission

Mission: **minimize human suffering by accelerating the development and accessibility of cures for diseases**—particularly dementia, mental illness, and chronic conditions—by leveraging **decentralized clinical trials, AI-driven research, and policy reform**.  

Key initiatives:  
- **Cure Acceleration Act** – A global framework to optimize public policy and incentives for rapid cure development.  
- **Decentralized FDA (dFDA)** – An open-source, automated clinical trial platform to remove bureaucratic bottlenecks.  
- **Right to Trial** – Ensuring patients can access experimental treatments and contribute data.  
- **Wishonia & AI Agents** – Systems for problem-solving, collective intelligence, and automating high-impact tasks.  
- **CureDAO & Crowdsourced Research** – Platforms for aggregating patient data and running decentralized, AI-assisted studies.  

At a higher level, I'm working toward **creating a civilization free of unnecessary suffering** by aligning incentives, decentralizing power structures, and leveraging technology to make cures cheaper, faster, and more accessible.
